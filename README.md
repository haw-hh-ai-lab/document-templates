document-templates
==================

These are document templates in the style of the HAW CI and will follow 
requirements on formating various document types.

Most of the settings are aimed at writing a text in german with german DIN
standards in addition to the standards set by the HAW-HH. I would like to hear
from any changes to improve generalization. The documentation and sample 
document also currently are available in german too.

This file is in english mainly as an aid for international readers to help 
understand the contents of this repository.

LaTeX
-----

You can find the german documentation on how to use them in the file 
	latex/haw_style.tex
for latex style. An example with a working directory structure is also
availiable in
	latex/sample_doc/sample_doc.tex

The format ist basically split in two parts: the actual style and a wrapping
style for aeach department. Take a look at 
	latex/texmf/latex/hawhhcs.sty
for the example for the department of computer science.

Open Document Format
--------------------

This is currently in a "pre-alpha proof of concept prototype" state, and likely
to stay there.
